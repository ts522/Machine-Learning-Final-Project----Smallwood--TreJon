# Machine Learning Final Project -- Smallwood, TreJon
 Machine learning Project for 4200 analyzing a dataset from kaggle
There seems to be a corlation between globalsales and genre, the corlation can be broken down farher sales in na, eu, and japan while viewing through the hue of platform.

With the linear regression the data was so varied it near impossible to plt. As for accuracy do to the varience of the data the accuracy ranged from 15% to 25% growing to up to 25 then a quick drop to 15 before staeading out.
The binary tree structure has 5 nodes and has the following tree structure:

node=0 is a split node: go to node 1 if X[:, 1] <= 0.20499999821186066 else to node 2.
	node=1 is a split node: go to node 3 if X[:, 0] <= 0.26500000059604645 else to node 4.
	node=2 is a leaf node.
		node=3 is a leaf node.
		node=4 is a leaf node.
